Requirements:

GTK+
Gnome
Pike 7.3.49 compiled with GTK and Gnome support.

Usage:

copy hdadmin-0.2.5/hdadmin_defaults.conf to /etc/hdadmin.conf 
and edit as needed.

$ cd hdadmin-0.2.5
$ pike -M. hdadmin.pike

If you don't run pike with the -M. flag, you'll get compilation errors.

Because HyperActive Directory Administrator is a graphically oriented
program, you should get a feel for its use without too much difficulty. As
a general rule, right clicking on an object will show you the options
available for that object.
